# Housing-Price-Estimation
This project aims to predict housing prices using a machine learning model trained on a given dataset. The model utilizes gradient descent algorithm for optimization and is implemented using Python programming language.

# Libraries Used:
Matplotlib: For data visualization, including histograms and graphs.
Numpy: For numerical computing and array operations.
Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
Scikit-learn (sklearn): For implementing machine learning algorithms.
Math: For mathematical operations.
# Files Included:
Jupyter Notebook File (.ipynb): This file contains the code along with visualizations such as histograms and graphs. It is recommended to run this file in Jupyter Notebook environment for better visualization.
Python Script File (.py): This file contains the Python code for the project. In case of any issues with the Python script, it's recommended to refer to the Jupyter Notebook file.
# Usage:
Clone the repository to your local machine.
Open the Jupyter Notebook file using Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab.
Run the cells in the notebook to execute the code and visualize the results.
If using the Python script, execute it in an environment with necessary libraries installed. If any issues arise, refer to the Jupyter Notebook file for troubleshooting.
# Dataset:
The dataset used for this project contains information about housing features such as area, number of rooms, location, etc., along with their corresponding prices. The model is trained on this dataset to learn the relationship between the features and the prices, enabling it to make accurate predictions.

# Approach:
The model employs gradient descent algorithm for optimization, iteratively adjusting the parameters to minimize the cost function and improve prediction accuracy. It utilizes features such as area, number of rooms, and other relevant factors to estimate the housing prices.

# Note:
For detailed explanations and visualizations, refer to the Jupyter Notebook file.
This project serves as a demonstration of machine learning techniques for housing price estimation and can be further extended or customized as per specific requirements.
